***BIG CHANGES***

 - Use trigraphs; try to make a layout with two rolls on one hand plus one key on the other. Do something like Carpalx.
 - Add shift, space, enter, backspace, tab. On Kinesis, add thumb pads and leftmost column.
 - Make it easier to add new physical keyboard types.
 - Write a subroutine that automatically generates a keyboard file for any platform.

***SMALL CHANGES***

 - Check to see which keys change between best layouts, and integrate that into smartMutate().
 - Moving further along one hand costs more. For example, moving from a pinky to an index finger costs more than moving from a middle finger to an index finger.
 - Every movement from one finger to another has its own specific cost.
 - Create an option to not use shifted keys.
 

***BUGS***

 - Numbers don't always stay where they are supposed to. On Kinesis, the keys get shifted over so that 2 is where 1 should be, 3 is where 2 should be, etc.

Possibly Fixed: 
 - Parallel parentheses don't work on the standard keyboard, only Kinesis.
 - After the algorithm runs for a while, either a character is duplicated or a character that's not supposed to be on the keyboard somehow creeps in.


***MISCELLANEOUS***

 - Convert layouts in allLayouts.txt to full-layout form.


***THUMBS***

 - Implement tab and thumb keys for the standard keyboard.
